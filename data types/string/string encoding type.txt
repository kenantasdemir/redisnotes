String Encoding Types
Redis decide the encoding automatically as per string value
int:For strings representing 64-bit signed integers
embstr:For strings whose length is less or equal to 44 bytes (this used to be 39 bytes in Redis 3.x); this type
of encoding is more efficient in memory usage and performance
raw :For strings whose length is greater than 44 bytes
