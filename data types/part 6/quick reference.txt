Quick Reference - HyperLogLog
A HyperLogLog is a probabilistic data structure

Used in order to count unique things (technically this is referred to estimating the cardinality of a set).

Encoded as a Redis string

Conceptually the HLL (HyperLogLog) is like using Sets to do the same task.

They are not one hundred percent accurate

By using HyperLogLogs we can save a tremendous amount of memory.

PFADD, PFCOUNT
